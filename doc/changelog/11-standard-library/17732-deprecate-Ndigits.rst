- **Deprecated:** :g:`NArith.Ndigits` and :g:`NArith.Ndist` due to disuse.
  For most uses of `Ndigits`, `N.testbit` and similar functions seem more
  desirable. If you would like to continue using these files, please consider
  volunteering to maintain them, within stdlib or otherwise
  (`#17732 <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/17732>`_,
  by Andres Erbsen).
